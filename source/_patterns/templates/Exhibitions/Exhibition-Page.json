It was the age of discovery. Portuguese and Spanish fleets explored the globe and artists were commissioned by royal patrons who wanted to show off their wealth and sophisticated ideas. Inventions in printing technology led to new ways of sharing art and influenced the subjects that artists chose to depict. Dürer was one of the first great sightseers in European painting creating one the most renowned self-portraits in art.</p>"

Large windows and glass roofs helped experiment with dimensions and brightened ambience in Art Nouveau buildings."

In 1892 Segal went to Berlin to study painting at the city’s fine arts academy.",
