Influenced by Japanese craft works, the interiors also exhibited elements from this culture which was still new to Europe.</p>"

Large windows and glass roofs helped experiment with dimensions and brightened ambience in Art Nouveau buildings."

He took no interest in schoolwork and felt excluded because he was Jewish. Arthur’s father wanted his son to become a banker and discouraged his early interest in art, but without success. In 1892 Segal went to Berlin to study painting at the city’s fine arts academy.",

Designed to resemble the shape of a tree, these columns branch out towards the ceiling reinforcing the grandeur of the interior."
